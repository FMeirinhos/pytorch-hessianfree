# pytorch-hessianfree
PyTorch implementation of Hessian Free optimisation

Implemented some parts of [Training Deep and Recurrent Networks with Hessian-Free Optimization](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8_27) by Martens and Sutskever (2012).

**Missing** preconditioner and some tests, use with caution!
